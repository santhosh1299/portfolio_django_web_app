    <p>
        According to Consumer Reports' 2023 Annual Auto Reliability Survey, electric vehicles have 79% reliability issues compared to gasoline cars. Battery-related issues are higher when we look into these issues in depth. Some issues like unexpected drops in driving range and reduced battery performance can be mitigated by predictive maintenance, which is the integration of Remaining Useful Life and discharge capacity prediction. It is very useful in guiding consumers to increase the lifespan and reliability of these batteries. Additionally, it can be integrated with dynamic charging algorithms to adapt charging patterns to ensure that minimizes degradation and maximizes the usable life.
    </p>

    <br>
    <p>
        There was some research done on leveraging the Deep Learning Models for battery degradation prediction. This involves analyzing the battery's health and degradation patterns. This research was done purely on MATLAB and there were some limitations on the flexibility compared to other frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch. Additionally, MATLAB may not be scalable for large-scale deep-learning objects. Another research was done on the Remaining Useful Life Prediction using the Stacked Autoencoder (SAE) and Gaussian Mixture Regression. This approach led to the introduction of indirect health indicators from the Voltage, Current, and Temperature data to overcome the practical limitations.  </p>   
    <p>
    <p>The intricate interplay between voltage and temperature within these batteries holds crucial implications for their overall performance and longevity. Throughout the charging and discharging cycles, voltage fluctuations serve as indicators of internal resistance changes and electrolyte behavior, offering invaluable insights into the battery's state of health. Analyzing voltage profiles across diverse charging conditions enables predictive models to accurately estimate the remaining capacity of the battery, facilitating proactive maintenance strategies to optimize its lifespan.Simultaneously, elevated temperatures present a formidable challenge, as they expedite degradation mechanisms within lithium-ion batteries, leading to capacity fade and compromised performance. By monitoring temperature variations during charging cycles, predictive maintenance strategies can effectively mitigate thermal stress and extend the battery's useful life. Moreover, the integration of voltage and temperature data from an array of charging profiles serves as the bedrock for the development of robust predictive maintenance techniques. Leveraging advanced analytics and machine learning algorithms, stakeholders can assess the profound impact of operational conditions on battery health with unprecedented accuracy.</p>

    <p>This proactive approach empowers stakeholders to implement timely interventions, such as adjusting charging protocols or deploying sophisticated thermal management strategies, to optimize battery performance and reliability. By making informed decisions grounded in comprehensive data analysis, stakeholders ensure the efficient and sustainable operation of lithium-ion battery systems across diverse applications. In essence, the seamless integration of voltage and temperature data not only enhances predictive maintenance capabilities but also lays the foundation for the continued advancement of energy storage technologies, driving innovation and sustainability in the modern era.</p>

        <p>This data set has been collected from a custom built battery prognostics testbed at the NASA Ames Prognostics Center of Excellence (PCoE). Li-ion batteries were run through 3 different operational profiles (charge, discharge and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy) at different temperatures. Discharges were carried out at different current load levels until the battery voltage fell to preset voltage thresholds. Some of these thresholds were lower than that recommended by the OEM (2.7 V) in order to induce deep discharge aging effects. Repeated charge and discharge cycles result in accelerated aging of the batteries. The experiments were stopped when the batteries reached the end-of-life (EOL) criteria of 30% fade in rated capacity (from 2 Ah to 1.4 Ah).</p>

    <h2>Clustering</h2>

    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>Clustering is like the pivotal element of unsupervised learning, it helps in bringing together data points based on their natural similarities, in multiple dimensions. It does not need labelled data as required by the supervised learning. Instead, it dives into the data, searching for hidden structures without any guidance or context of the data. As it sifts through the dataset, clusters start to form, like groups of data points, each sharing common patterns or behaviors. 
        These clusters shed light on the different personalities within the data, revealing patterns and connections we might not have noticed before. It is usually used in research where the labels are created by clustering and it helps in providing more context abt the data from the inner lying patterns
        </p>

        <p>In the context of predicting discharge capacity in lithium-ion batteries, clustering techniques can be leveraged to identify thresholds for data discretization. By analyzing features related to battery performance, such as voltage, temperature, and charging profiles, clustering algorithms can effectively group similar data points together based on their intrinsic characteristics. This clustering information provides a nuanced understanding of the dataset's structure, highlighting distinct clusters that exhibit varying levels of correlation with discharge capacity.</p>
        <p>Moreover, by excluding the discharge capacity feature from the clustering process, we can focus solely on identifying patterns in other relevant features that may indirectly influence discharge capacity. Through this approach, clusters with similar characteristics to discharge capacity can be identified, providing valuable insights into the factors that contribute to battery performance. Subsequently, these clustering results can inform the data discretization process, guiding the selection of appropriate thresholds for binning continuous variables into discrete categories.</p>
        <p>By incorporating clustering information into the data discretization process, we can ensure that the resulting discretized features capture meaningful variations in battery performance while minimizing information loss. This iterative approach enhances the interpretability and predictive power of subsequent models built upon the discretized data. Ultimately, leveraging clustering algorithms in this manner enables us to extract actionable insights from the dataset and optimize the predictive accuracy of discharge capacity models in lithium-ion battery systems.</p>

    
    <h4>Types</h4>

    <h4>Partitional Clustering</h4>
    <br>
     
      <img src={% static 'portfolio/clustering/partitional_clust.png' %} alt="api-logo" width="500" height="483">
      <br>
    <ul>
        <li>
          It divides the dataset into non-overlapping groups based on their distance from one another. It is suitable for large datasets as it is scalable and efficient.
        </li>
        <li>
          The cluster numbers are specified by the analyst, and there are ways to find an optimal number of clusters best for the data when there is no idea about the actual context of the data.
        </li>
        <li>
          It includes methods like K-means and K-modes.
        </li>
      </ul>
    <h4>KMeans</h4>
    <p>In K-means clustering, the algorithm partitions the data into K clusters by iteratively assigning each data point to the nearest cluster centroid and updating the centroids based on the mean of the points in each cluster. K-means is widely used due to its simplicity and efficiency, but it requires specifying the number of clusters beforehand.</p>

   

    <h4>Hierachical Clustering</h4>

    <br>
     
      <img src={% static 'portfolio/clustering/heirar_clust.png' %} alt="api-logo" width="500" height="395">
      <br>
    <p>Hierarchical clustering is a technique that creates a hierarchical tree-like structure of clusters, where each node represents a cluster. This method does not require the analyst to specify the number of clusters beforehand and is particularly useful when the dataset's structure is not well understood.
    </p>
    <h4>Agglomerative  Clustering</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
          Agglomerative clustering, also known as bottom-up clustering, starts with each data point as a separate cluster. It iteratively merges the closest clusters until a single cluster containing all data points is formed.
        </li>
        <li>
          It considers each cluster as a single cluster and merges two clusters as one until there is only one cluster remaining.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <h4>Linking methods</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
          Single Linkage: Merge the clusters based on the smallest distance between any points in the two clusters.
        </li>
        <li>
          Complete Linkage: Merge the clusters based on the maximum distance between any points in the two clusters.
        </li>
        <li>
          Average Linkage: Merge the clusters based on the average distance between any points in the two clusters.
        </li>
      </ul>
      

    <h4>Divisive  Clustering</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
          Divisive clustering, also known as top-down clustering, starts with all data points in a single cluster and recursively splits clusters into smaller clusters until each cluster contains only one data point.
        </li>
        <li>
          It is the opposite of Agglomerative clustering. It clusters the data by considering all data points as one and splits them until each data point becomes a cluster. The splitting on each iteration is based on two criteria: intercluster dissimilarity and intercluster similarity.
        </li>
      </ul>
      
     <h3>Commonly Used Distance Metrics</h3>
     <h4>Euclidean Distance</h4>
<p>
  Perhaps the most widely used distance metric, Euclidean distance measures the straight-line distance between two data points in Euclidean space. It is calculated as the square root of the sum of squared differences between corresponding coordinates of two points. Euclidean distance is suitable for continuous numeric data and assumes that the data points are distributed in a continuous space.
</p>

<h4>Manhattan Distance</h4>
<p>
  Also known as city block distance or taxicab distance, Manhattan distance measures the sum of the absolute differences between corresponding coordinates of two points. It represents the distance traveled along axes at right angles. Manhattan distance is suitable for data with attributes measured on different scales or for which the concept of straight-line distance may not be meaningful.
</p>

<h4>Cosine Similarity</h4>
<p>
  Unlike Euclidean and Manhattan distances, cosine similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors, representing the similarity in direction rather than magnitude. It is commonly used for text data, where documents are represented as vectors of word frequencies or TF-IDF scores. Cosine similarity is robust to differences in vector magnitudes and is effective for measuring similarity between sparse vectors.
</p>


    <h3>Density-based Clustering</h3>

    <br>
     
      <img src={% static 'portfolio/clustering/density_based.png' %} alt="api-logo" width="500" height="493">
      <br>
    <ul>
        <li>
          Density-based clustering is a type of clustering algorithm that identifies clusters based on the density of data points in the feature space.
        </li>
        <li>
          Unlike partitioning or hierarchical clustering, which assume that clusters have well-defined boundaries, density-based clustering methods can discover clusters of arbitrary shapes and sizes.
        </li>
        <li>
          One popular density-based clustering algorithm is DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise).
        </li>
        <li>
          The main advantages of density-based clustering are its ability to handle clusters of arbitrary shapes and sizes and its robustness to noise and outliers.
        </li>
      </ul>

<br>
      <p>Clustering algorithms involve mathematical operations such as calculating centroids, updating cluster assignments, or determining cluster distances. These operations are more straightforward to perform on numeric data, as mathematical operations are well-defined for numerical values. Handling categorical or text data requires additional preprocessing steps, such as one-hot encoding or feature scaling, to convert them into numeric format.

      <h3>Results</h3>
      <br>
<p>In the course of our analysis, particular emphasis was placed on the pivotal role of voltage and battery attributes. To illuminate our findings, we employed K-means clustering to discern distinct patterns within our dataset. Leveraging the resulting clusters, we embarked on a process of discretizing our output variables, notably the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) and discharge capacity. With a silhouette score of 11 indicating well-defined clusters, we juxtaposed the clustering outcomes alongside the RUL and discharge capacity values in a scatter plot. This strategic visualization allowed for a comprehensive examination of how these values are clustered and their interrelation within the broader dataset. By integrating clustering results with output variable discretization, we have gained valuable insights into the intricate relationships between input and output variables. This approach not only facilitates the identification of underlying patterns but also enhances our understanding of how these variables contribute to the overall clustering structure, thereby enriching the depth of our analysis and guiding informed decision-making processes.</p>

      <p>It can be inferred from the above chart that, we can start with having 4 clusters and perform kmeans.</p>

      <br>
     <p>This is similar to the clusters based on the Kmeans clustering but since the K value is 6 it has split some clusters providing some valid insights for the data discretization process.</p>
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>Integrating clustering analysis into our modeling framework not only provided valuable insights into battery performance but also significantly enriched our predictive capabilities for both Remaining Useful Life (RUL) and discharge capacity. By stratifying the data into distinct clusters based on similarities in key features, we were able to develop cluster-specific predictive models tailored to the unique degradation patterns observed within each cluster. This approach not only enhanced the accuracy of our RUL predictions but also enabled more precise estimates of discharge capacity over time. For instance, clusters exhibiting accelerated degradation rates were characterized by distinct sets of predictive variables, allowing us to identify early warning signs of capacity loss and predict RUL more accurately than traditional methods.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the clustering analysis facilitated the identification of critical features driving variations in both RUL and discharge capacity across different battery states. By isolating the most influential variables within each cluster, we were able to refine our predictive models and capture subtle nuances in battery degradation dynamics more effectively. This comprehensive understanding of the underlying factors influencing RUL and discharge capacity enabled us to develop predictive models that are not only more accurate but also more robust to real-world variability. As a result, our approach holds immense promise for optimizing battery management strategies and prolonging the operational lifespan of battery systems in diverse applications, ranging from electric vehicles to renewable energy storage.</p>

    </a>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h4>Overview</h4>
   <p>Association Rule Mining (ARM) is a data mining technique used to discover relationships or associations between items or variables in a dataset. It is commonly applied to transactional data, where each transaction consists of a set of items purchased together. ARM aims to uncover patterns in these transactions that can provide valuable insights for various applications, such as market basket analysis and recommendation systems.

    For example, consider a retail store that records transactions from its customers. Each transaction contains a list of items purchased by a customer during a single visit to the store. By applying ARM to this transactional data, the store can discover associations between different items frequently purchased together. These associations can be represented as rules of the form "If {A} then {B}", indicating that customers who buy item A are likely to buy item B as well.</p> 
    <h4>Description</h4>
<br>
    <img src={% static 'portfolio/clustering/arm_formula.png' %} alt="api-logo" width="500" height="500">

    </a>
    <br><br>
    <p>ARM involves analyzing transactional data to find relationships or associations between items or variables in the data. It helps in various areas such as market basket analysis and recommendation systems.</p>
    
    <h4>Support</h4>
    <p>Support is a measure used in ARM to indicate the frequency of occurrence of a particular itemset in the dataset. It helps identify the most frequent itemsets or combinations of items.</p>
    
    <h4>Confidence</h4>
    <p>Confidence is a measure used in ARM to indicate the reliability of a rule. It measures the likelihood that an item B is purchased given that item A is purchased.</p>
    
    <h4>Lift</h4>
    <p>Lift is a measure used to evaluate the strength of association between two items. It compares the likelihood of two items occurring together to the likelihood of their occurrence being independent of each other.</p>
    
    <h4>What are rules?</h4>
    <p>Association rules are statements that describe the relationships between items in a dataset. They are typically in the form of "If {A} then {B}", where A and B are itemsets.</p>
    
    <h4>What is Apriori?</h4>
    <p>The Apriori algorithm is a popular algorithm used for mining association rules. It works by iteratively generating candidate itemsets and pruning those that do not meet the minimum support threshold.</p>
    
    <h4>Its Working</h4>
    <p>The Apriori algorithm starts by identifying frequent itemsets through iterative candidate generation and pruning. It then generates association rules based on these frequent itemsets, providing valuable insights into the data.</p>

    <h3>Data Prep </h3>
    <h4>Conversion of Data into Transaction Data</h4>
    <p>Transaction data is typically represented as a dataset where each row corresponds to a transaction, and the items purchased in that transaction are listed. To convert raw data into transaction data suitable for Association Rule Mining (ARM), you need to aggregate the data into transactional format. This is commonly done by identifying unique transactions and listing the items associated with each transaction.</p>
    <p>For example, consider a dataset containing sales data for a retail store. Each row in the dataset represents a sale, with columns indicating the transaction ID and the items purchased. To convert this data into transaction format, you would aggregate the items purchased in each transaction and create a list of items associated with each unique transaction ID.</p>
    
    <h4>Why Unnlabelled Transaction Data is used?</h4>
    <p>Unlabeled transaction data is preferred in Association Rule Mining (ARM) due to its flexibility and ability to uncover hidden patterns without predefined labels or categories. With unlabeled data, there's no need to specify predefined categories for items, allowing for the discovery of associations between any items present in the dataset. This approach enables the extraction of insights from raw transactional data, particularly in real-world scenarios where items may not come with predefined labels. Analyzing unlabeled transaction data simplifies the analysis process and facilitates the discovery of generalizable patterns that hold across different contexts. By focusing on the co-occurrence of items in transactions, ARM algorithms can identify common purchasing behaviors and item relationships, providing valuable insights for various industries and domains.</p>

    From the ARM network analysis of recent news text data, it becomes apparent that certain keywords such as "pixel," "meta," "quest," "hour," and others were prominently featured. Upon closer examination of this data, it is evident that there has been a significant focus on topics related to the Meta Quest Pro and the Apple iPhone over the past month. This suggests a notable trend in the news landscape, with increased coverage and discussions revolving around these particular subjects. Such insights gleaned from the analysis underscore the relevance and impact of these technological developments within the media sphere, reflecting evolving consumer interests and industry dynamics.</p>

   <h4>Top 10 rules by Support</h4>
   <br>

   <img src={% static 'portfolio/clustering/arm_support.png' %} alt="api-logo" width="600" height="371">
   <br>
   <p>An intriguing observation from these association rules is the strong presence of specific electronic devices like "iphone" and "galaxy" in conjunction with mentions of "battery". The rule ({iphone} => {battery}) stands out with a relatively high confidence of 61.54% and a lift value of 8.58, indicating a significant association between discussions related to iPhones and the presence of battery-related topics.

    <h2>NaiveBayes</h2>
    <img src={% static 'portfolio/NB & DecTree/nb_1.jpg' %} alt="api-logo" width="500" height="500">
    <br>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>Naive Bayes is a simple but powerful probabilistic classification algorithm based on Bayes' theorem with the "naive" assumption of independence between features. Despite its simplicity, it's widely used in various applications due to its efficiency and effectiveness, particularly in text classification and spam filtering.</p>

<p>One of the key applications of Naive Bayes is in text classification tasks. It's commonly used for sentiment analysis, document categorization, topic classification, and spam detection. In sentiment analysis, Naive Bayes can determine whether a piece of text expresses positive, negative, or neutral sentiment based on the words used. For document categorization, it can classify documents into predefined categories such as news articles, emails, or research papers. In spam detection, Naive Bayes can identify whether an email is spam or not based on its content and other features.</p>

<p>Another important application of Naive Bayes is in medical diagnosis and healthcare analytics. It can be used to predict the likelihood of a patient having a particular disease based on symptoms, test results, and other medical data. Naive Bayes classifiers have been employed in various medical domains, including cancer detection, disease risk assessment, and patient outcome prediction.</p>

<h2>Applications of Naive Bayes</h2>

<p>Naive Bayes is a versatile classification algorithm with numerous applications across different domains:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Text Classification:</strong> Naive Bayes is extensively used in sentiment analysis, document categorization, topic classification, and spam detection tasks. It can analyze text data to determine sentiment, categorize documents, identify topics, and detect spam emails efficiently.</li>

  <li><strong>Healthcare Analytics:</strong> In medical diagnosis, Naive Bayes can predict the likelihood of a patient having a particular disease based on symptoms and medical data. It's applied in cancer detection, disease risk assessment, and patient outcome prediction.</li>

  <li><strong>Recommendation Systems:</strong> Naive Bayes is employed in recommendation systems to analyze user preferences and item features, recommending products, movies, music, or articles based on user interests.</li>

  <li><strong>Fraud Detection:</strong> In fraud detection, Naive Bayes identifies potentially fraudulent transactions or activities by analyzing patterns and features associated with known fraudulent behavior.</li>

  <li><strong>Anomaly Detection:</strong> Naive Bayes detects unusual patterns in data, such as network intrusions or credit card fraud, by identifying deviations from normal behavior.</li>

  <li><strong>Document Summarization:</strong> Naive Bayes aids in summarizing documents by extracting key information and identifying important content.</li>

  <li><strong>Customer Segmentation:</strong> It helps in segmenting customers based on their behavior, preferences, and demographics, facilitating targeted marketing strategies.</li>

  <li><strong>Market Basket Analysis:</strong> Naive Bayes is used to analyze customer purchase patterns and identify associations between items bought together in transactions.</li>

  <li><strong>Weather Prediction:</strong> In meteorology, Naive Bayes assists in predicting weather conditions by analyzing historical data and environmental factors.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Standard Multinomial Naive Bayes</h2>

<p>Standard Multinomial Naive Bayes is a variant of the Naive Bayes algorithm that is specifically designed for text classification tasks, where the features are typically discrete word counts or frequencies. It's widely used in natural language processing (NLP) applications such as sentiment analysis, document categorization, and spam filtering. Let's delve into the details of how Multinomial Naive Bayes works and its key components:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Probability Model:</strong> Multinomial Naive Bayes models the probability distribution of word occurrences in documents using a multinomial distribution. It assumes that each feature (word) follows a multinomial distribution conditioned on the class label.</li>

  <li><strong>Feature Representation:</strong> In text classification tasks, documents are represented as feature vectors, where each feature represents the count or frequency of a word in the document. Typically, a bag-of-words or TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) representation is used.</li>

  <li><strong>Class Prior Probability:</strong> Multinomial Naive Bayes calculates the prior probability of each class based on the frequency of class occurrences in the training data. This provides the initial probability of each class before observing any features.</li>

  <li><strong>Conditional Probability:</strong> The algorithm computes the conditional probability of observing each feature (word) given the class label using the multinomial distribution. It estimates the likelihood of observing a particular word in documents belonging to a specific class.</li>

  <li><strong>Naive Assumption:</strong> Similar to the standard Naive Bayes algorithm, Multinomial Naive Bayes makes the "naive" assumption of feature independence, i.e., it assumes that the occurrence of each word is independent of the occurrences of other words within the same document, given the class label.</li>

  <li><strong>Laplace Smoothing:</strong> To handle the issue of zero probabilities for unseen words in the test data, Laplace smoothing (or additive smoothing) is often applied. It adds a small smoothing parameter to the word counts to ensure that no probability becomes zero.</li>

  <li><strong>Classification Decision:</strong> Finally, to classify a new document, Multinomial Naive Bayes applies Bayes' theorem to compute the posterior probability of each class given the observed features. The class with the highest posterior probability is assigned as the predicted class for the document.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Benefits of Multinomial Naive Bayes:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Efficient: It's computationally efficient and scales well with large datasets.</li>
  <li>Effective for Text Data: Well-suited for text classification tasks due to its ability to handle discrete features like word counts.</li>
  <li>Simple and Interpretable: The algorithm is easy to understand and interpret, making it suitable for both beginners and experts in NLP.</li>
</ul>



<h2>Bernoulli Naive Bayes</h2>

<p>Bernoulli Naive Bayes is another variant of the Naive Bayes algorithm commonly used in text classification tasks, particularly when the feature vectors are binary-valued. It's well-suited for applications such as sentiment analysis, document categorization, and spam filtering. Let's explore the details of how Bernoulli Naive Bayes operates and its key aspects:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Probability Model:</strong> Bernoulli Naive Bayes models the probability distribution of binary feature occurrences in documents using a Bernoulli distribution. It assumes that each feature (word) follows a Bernoulli distribution conditioned on the class label.</li>

  <li><strong>Feature Representation:</strong> In Bernoulli Naive Bayes, documents are represented as binary feature vectors, where each feature indicates the presence (1) or absence (0) of a word in the document. This binary representation is suitable for scenarios where only the presence of words matters, not their frequencies.</li>

  <li><strong>Class Prior Probability:</strong> Similar to other Naive Bayes variants, Bernoulli Naive Bayes calculates the prior probability of each class based on the frequency of class occurrences in the training data, providing the initial probability of each class before observing any features.</li>

  <li><strong>Conditional Probability:</strong> The algorithm computes the conditional probability of observing each feature (word) given the class label using the Bernoulli distribution. It estimates the likelihood of observing a particular word in documents belonging to a specific class.</li>

  <li><strong>Naive Assumption:</strong> Bernoulli Naive Bayes, like other Naive Bayes algorithms, makes the "naive" assumption of feature independence, assuming that the presence or absence of each word is independent of other words within the same document, given the class label.</li>

  <li><strong>Laplace Smoothing:</strong> To handle zero probabilities for unseen words in the test data, Laplace smoothing (or additive smoothing) can be applied in Bernoulli Naive Bayes. It adds a small smoothing parameter to the feature counts to prevent zero probabilities.</li>

  <li><strong>Classification Decision:</strong> To classify a new document, Bernoulli Naive Bayes applies Bayes' theorem to compute the posterior probability of each class given the observed features. The class with the highest posterior probability is assigned as the predicted class for the document.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Benefits of Bernoulli Naive Bayes:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Effective for Binary Features: Well-suited for text classification tasks with binary feature representations, such as presence or absence of words.</li>
  <li>Simple and Efficient: Like other Naive Bayes algorithms, Bernoulli Naive Bayes is computationally efficient and easy to implement.</li>
  <li>Interpretability: The algorithm provides interpretable results, making it suitable for explaining the classification decisions.</li>
</ul>

   <h3>Results</h3>

   <br>
   <p>We noticed that our data had a significant imbalance between classes, meaning some classes were much more prevalent than others. Despite achieving 63% accuracy with a multinomial Naive Bayes model, upon analyzing the confusion matrix, we found discrepancies that raised concerns. To address this, we employed SMOTE, a technique for mitigating class imbalance by generating synthetic samples. However, after implementing SMOTE and retraining the multinomial model, we were disappointed to find a drastic drop in accuracy to only 28%. This outcome puzzled us, leading us to reconsider our approach. We realized that multinomial Naive Bayes is typically suited for text data or categorical data with count frequencies, whereas our data consisted of numerical features. Therefore, we decided to pivot to a Gaussian Naive Bayes model, which is better suited for numerical data. This adjustment was made with the hope of improving our model's performance by aligning it more closely with the nature of our dataset.</p>

    <img src={% static 'portfolio/NB & DecTree/dtree_1.jpg' %} alt="api-logo" width="500" height="500">
    <br>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>Decision Trees are like maps that guide decisions based on a series of questions. Each question leads to more questions until a conclusion is reached. Imagine navigating a flowchart where each step helps determine the best course of action. Similarly, Decision Trees start with a broad question and gradually narrow down options based on the answers provided. This intuitive approach makes Decision Trees easy to understand, even for those unfamiliar with technical concepts.</p>
    <p>Now, let's delve into how Decision Trees are trained. During training, the algorithm learns from existing data to create this decision-making map. It analyzes different features, such as age or income, and splits the data into groups based on the most informative questions. By repeatedly asking and refining these questions, the algorithm constructs a tree-like structure that accurately predicts outcomes. This process mimics how humans make decisions, making it accessible and relatable to non-technical team members.</p>
    <p>As the Decision Tree is trained, it aims to minimize confusion and maximize clarity in decision-making. It's like organizing information into categories, making it easier to process and act upon. Through this iterative process, the Decision Tree becomes a valuable tool for guiding future decisions, empowering teams to navigate complex scenarios with confidence.</p>

    <h2>Decision Making Process</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Tree Structure:</strong> Decision Trees start with a root node representing the entire dataset and recursively split the data into smaller subsets as they move down the tree.</li>
      <li><strong>Node Splitting:</strong> At each node, the algorithm selects features and split points to maximize subset homogeneity.</li>
      <li><strong>Stopping Criteria:</strong> The splitting process continues until specific criteria, such as maximum depth or minimum impurity, are met.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h2>Training Process</h2>
    <p><strong>Overview:</strong> During training, Decision Trees learn from existing data to create decision-making maps.</p>
    <h3>Feature Selection</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Criteria:</strong> Features are evaluated based on criteria such as Gini impurity or entropy to determine the best splits.</li>
      <li><strong>Information Gain:</strong> Information gain quantifies the reduction in impurity achieved by splitting data on a particular feature.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Recursive Splitting</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Partitioning Data:</strong> The algorithm partitions the dataset into subsets based on feature values to create homogeneous subsets.</li>
      <li><strong>Stopping Criteria:</strong> The recursive splitting process continues until stopping criteria, like maximum depth or minimum impurity decrease, are met.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h2>Prediction Process</h2>
    <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Predictions for new instances involve traversing the tree from the root to a leaf node based on feature values.</p>
    <h3>Traversal</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Decision Path:</strong> The tree is traversed, evaluating feature values at each node to determine the appropriate branch.</li>
      <li><strong>Leaf Node Prediction:</strong> Once a leaf node is reached, the associated prediction is returned.</li>
